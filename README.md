# Relationships_java
Class relationships in Java define the special relationships among different kinds of classes.
1) **Dependance (Uses-A)**
   
   When we create an object of a class inside a method of another class, this relationship is called dependence relationship in Java, or simply Uses-A relationship.
   In other words, when a method of a class uses an object of another class, it is called dependency in java. It is the most obvious and most general relationship in java.
