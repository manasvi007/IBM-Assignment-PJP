# Relationships_java
Class relationships in Java define the special relationships among different kinds of classes.
1) **Dependance (Uses-A)**
   
   When we create an object of a class inside a method of another class, this relationship is called dependence relationship in Java, or simply Uses-A relationship.
   In other words, when a method of a class uses an object of another class, it is called dependency in java. It is the most obvious and most general relationship in java.

   I have built 3 different files namely:  Phone.java, LandlinePhone.java, MobilePhone.java, Main.java and corresponding code is given below:

2) **Association (Has-A)**

   Association is another fundamental relationship between classes that is informally known as “Has-A” relationship.
   When an object of one class is created as data member inside another class, it is called association relationship in java or simply Has-A relationship.

   **Java**

   I have built 3 different files namely:  Library.java, Book.java, Main.java and corresponding code is given below:

3) **Inheritance (Is-A)**

   Inheritance represents Is-a relationship in Java. It establishes a relationship between a more general class (known as superclass) and a more specialized class (known as subclass).
   In other words, Is-A relationship defines the relationship between two classes in which one class extends another class.

   **Java**

   I have built 3 different files namely:  Fruit.java, Apple.java, Main.java and corresponding code is given below:
